# To-Do-Today
“To-Do Today” is an application that enables you to record and/or update your reminders. So as to keep you informed of tour list, the list will be saved as your desktop background.

To apply your reminders as your desktop backgroud image; first run the program (you may add/remove your reminders on the list there), then after closing the window, go to the directory in which the files of the program are saved, select "back.bmp" and "back.png" and set them as desktop background. From then on, run the application (update your list), and right click on the desktop and choose "Next Desktop Background".  

The application is best designed for Windows computers, although some features might work for other systems, users may not experience all it has to provide. It might sometimes help to run the program through command prompt.
